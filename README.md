[Documentation](https://docs.rs/stacker)

A stack-growth library for Rust. Enables annotating fixed points in programs
where the stack may want to grow larger. Spills over to the heap if the stack
has hit its limit.

This library is intended on helping implement recursive algorithms.

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
stacker = "0.1"
```

## Platform Support

This library currently uses psm for its cross platform capabilities, with a notable exception of
Windows, which uses an implementation based on Fibers. See the README for psm for the support
table.

On all unsupported platforms this library is a noop. It should compile and run, but it
won't actually grow the stack and code will continue to hit the guard pages
typically in place.
